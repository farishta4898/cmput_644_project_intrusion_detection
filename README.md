# cmput_644_project_intrusion_detection

The proejct code was originally run on colab and the files were hosted on google drive. The python notebook files also contain the same paths and files. The saved models are also on the same folder. This is the link for the drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MHyxEzGid7USwT2xgLBqbxtQgPRt1f14

The codes should be re-execuatble and re-producable with the change of paths and right dataset files given in the drive. Also, the notebook files contains all the necessary outputs and finding from the experiments.
