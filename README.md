## The project code was originally run on Google Colab and the files were hosted on Google Drive. The Python notebook files also contain the same paths and files. The saved models are also in the same folder. This is the link for the drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MHyxEzGid7USwT2xgLBqbxtQgPRt1f14

## The codes should be re-executable and re-producible with the change of paths and the right dataset files given in the drive. Also, the notebook files contain all the necessary outputs and findings from the experiments.
